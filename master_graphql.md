# Master GraphQL Zone

If you are reading this, it means you have either completed all the tasks, or you skipped ahead. Either way I am very proud of you.
For your reward, there is a number of unguided tasks for you to complete at your leisure.

## Exercise #1
Using the Github GraphQL API, write a mutation to star this repository.

## Exercise #2
Using the Github GraphQL API, write a query to find the first comment on a GitHub Pull Request

## Exercise #3
You can add plants using the Angular app we created, but you can't remove them. Add a remove button and integrate it with
a new mutation on the server.

## Exercise #4
We had some big dreams about adding zombies into the Angular Webapp but it never happened. Add the zombies into the angular
webapp in some form. Hopefully you use the plantHitZombie mutation :)

## Exercise #5
There is a [pokemon GraphQL endpoint](https://pokeapi-graphiql.herokuapp.com/) out there. Write an amazing query to help
your Pokemon Go! co-workers look up some pokemon or something.

## Exercise #6
Reactive is the future!!! Play around with graphql and webflux... show us your stuff.
